₿ Crypto Analysis: Real-Time Visualization and Exploratory Data AnalysisThis repository contains a full project focused on cryptocurrency market analysis, combining historical data exploration using Jupyter Notebooks and a live, streaming data visualization dashboard built with Plotly Dash.The project demonstrates proficiency in data acquisition (via yfinance and ccxt), technical analysis visualization (Candlestick, Bollinger Bands), and building interactive web applications for financial data.🚀 Project ComponentsThe project is divided into two main parts:File NameDescriptionKey FocusCrypto_EDA.ipynbExploratory Data Analysis NotebookDeep dive into historical crypto data (e.g., BTC, BNB, XRP) including descriptive statistics, return analysis, and advanced charting (Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages).realtime_crypto.pyLive Dash Visualization AppA Python script that runs a Dash web application to display a real-time (1-minute interval) updating Candlestick and Volume chart for a specified cryptocurrency (default: XRP/USDT) using the ccxt library.📊 Real-Time Dashboard (realtime_crypto.py)This application provides a dynamic, live-updating view of cryptocurrency trading data.FeaturesReal-Time Data: Fetches live 1-minute OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data from Binance using the ccxt library.Candlestick Chart: Displays interactive candlestick plot using Plotly for price action analysis.Volume Subplot: Includes a synchronized volume bar chart underneath the price action.Interval Control: The chart updates every 5 seconds to refresh the latest 1-minute candle.⚙️ How to Run the Live AppPrerequisites: You need Python 3.x installed.Install Dependencies:pip install dash pandas plotly ccxt
Run the script:python realtime_crypto.py

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (Crypto_EDA.ipynb)The Jupyter Notebook documents the process of acquiring and analyzing historical data for multiple crypto assets.Key Analysis & VisualizationsData Acquisition: Uses yfinance to pull historical OHLC data.Return Analysis: Calculates and identifies maximum return dates and values, and minimum return dates and values (as seen in the uploaded screenshot for BNB, BTC, ETH, and XRP).Advanced Charting: Includes a professional Candlestick chart complete with Bollinger Bands (MA20, Upper Band, Lower Band) for technical insights.Tools and LibrariesCategoryLibraryPurposeDatapandas, numpyData manipulation and numerical operations.Acquisitionccxt, yfinanceFetching real-time and historical financial data.VisualizationPlotly, DashCreating interactive, professional charts and the web dashboard.🖼️ Project ScreenshotsReal-Time Dash ApplicationHistorical EDA Notebook (Bollinger Bands)Getty ImagesLive chart view of BTC-USD dataHistorical analysis showing Bollinger Bands on XRP/USDThis project was developed for demonstration and educational purposes only and is not financial advice.
